## Stack_based_calculator
Takes user input as a string, then solves it to give a number output. It can solve arthimetic , relational , Bitwise and logical operators.

## Working
It works with the help of two stacks in which numbers and operator are pushed , poped and then solved as binary equation with the help of operator precedence and associativity
>For sample INPUT and OUTPUT format see comments in CODE.c file
